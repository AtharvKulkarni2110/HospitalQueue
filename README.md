# Hospital Queue Management System

It is Project helpful for clinics and Hospitals to track patients record


-This is a basic C++ console application that simulates a hospital queue. You can:

  - Add patients to the queue

  - Serve patients using priority queue order

  - Search and delete Patient by their name from the queue


The project utilizes priority queue to store the queue dynamically and serve patients on the basis of priority of seriousness of problem.

 - Serve patients one by one (on the basis of priority)

 - Display all current patients in the queue

 - Search Patient by their name

 - Delete Patient by their name from queue
  
 - Runs until you choose to exit

 - Uses OOP concepts and dynamic memory (new / delete)

   unordered_map: Used to track the priority of common problems

   Struct: Used for each Patient node
